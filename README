This module provides proxy server for Accumulo. It enables using languages 
other than Java to interact with the database.

1. Building

The proxy server is built by the Accumulo build process. Read ../README
for more information.

2. Installation

The proxy server is installed during the Accumulo install. Read ../README
for more information.

3. Configuration

Please note the Proxy Server only functions correctly when connected to an 
Accumulo 1.5 instance, or when run standalone in the Mock configuration.

 - connect to the Accumulo installation directory.

 - copy the proxy.properties file so that you have a backup.

 - edit the proxy.properties file.
    - change the useMockInstance value to 'true' if you wish to use an in-memory Mock instance.
    - change the useMiniAccumulo value to 'true' if you wish to use a Mini Accumulo Cluster.
    - change the instance value as needed.
    - change the zookeepers value as needed.

4. Execution

Connect to the Accumulo installation directory and run the following command.

 ./bin/accumulo proxy -p proxy/proxy.properties

5. Clients

You need the language-specific library for Thrift installed to be able to use said thrift client 
code in that language. In other words, you need the python thrift library installed to use the python 
example.

An example java client is incuded with this distribution in the class TestProxyClient. Also the 
unit tests included show how to use the proxy. Normal Accumulo APIs are emulated whereever possible.

Additional client examples can be found in the examples directory. These clients are tested and 
function, however, the setup for each language is beyond the scope of this document currently.

In general, to create a client for a new language, you must compile the proxy.thrift API (along 
with the accumulo core data.thrift API) to the language of choice. Then you include the resulting 
generated code along with the thrift core library for that language to use the proxy.

6. Special Note

Many of the example clients assume "secret" is your root password.  To make the examples 
work, change the example code to match your password, do not change your root password 
to "secret".
